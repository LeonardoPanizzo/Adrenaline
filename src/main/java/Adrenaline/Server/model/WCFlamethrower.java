 * choose 1 target and give it 1 damage.
 * in barbecue mode: Choose 2 squares as above. Deal 2 damage to
 * everyone on the first square and 1 damage to everyone on the second
 * square.
 * Notes: This weapon cannot damage anyone in your square. However,
 * it can sometimes damage a target you can't see â€“ the flame won't go
 * through walls, but it will go through doors. Think of it as a straight-line
 * blast of flame that can travel 2 squares in a cardinal direction.
